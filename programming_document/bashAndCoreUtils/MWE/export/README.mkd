export makes the variable available to sub-processes.

export name=value
means that the variable name is available to any process you run from that shell process. If you want a process to make use of this variable, use export, and run the process from that shell.

name=value
means the variable scope is restricted to the shell, and is not available to any other process. You would use this for (say) loop variables, temporary variables etc.
