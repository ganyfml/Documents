```
  TimeKeeper time_keeper(Timer());
```

The above code is ambiguous, since it could be interpreted either as
- a variable definition for variable time_keeper of class `TimeKeeper`, initialized with an anonymous instance of class Timer or
- a function declaration for a function time_keeper which returns an object of type `TimeKeeper` and has a single (unnamed) parameter which is a function returning type Timer (and taking no input).
